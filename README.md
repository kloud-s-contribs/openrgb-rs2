==========

**Rust client library for [OpenRGB SDK](https://openrgb.org).**

See [documentation](https://docs.rs/openrgb) and [examples](https://github.com/Achtuur/openrgb-rs2/tree/master/examples).

# Example

```rust
use openrgb2::{OpenRgbClient, OpenRgbResult};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> OpenRgbResult<()> {
    // connect to local server
    let client = OpenRgbClient::connect().await?;

    let controllers = client.get_all_controllers().await?;
    for c in controllers {
        println!("controller {}: {:#?}", c.id(), c.name());
        // the LEDs should now be a rainbow
        c.init().await?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```


# Original openrgb-rs

This repository is a clone of the repo previously maintaed by [nicoulaj](https://github.com/nicoulaj/openrgb-rs). I have attempted to reach out to them, but received no response. As a result I decided to republish the OpenRGB SDK under a new name (`openrgb-rs2`).

## Whats different?

Support for OpenRGB protocol versions 4 and 5 is added. There's also now a friendlier to use API than before.

Internally there's some changes in how serializing/deserializing the protocol is done. I decided it was easier to read/write to a buffer, rather than directly to a stream as was previously done. For the end user there should not be much visible change though. I have not done any benchmarking, so I'm not sure about the performance. I can update my entire rig at about 300 FPS at release mode, so I'm not too worried about performance anyway.
